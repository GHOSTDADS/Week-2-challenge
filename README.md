# Bootcamp Week 2 challenge

## Description

This is the home work for week two of the bootcamp course.
It is an online portfolio for me to use/fill in, as I build more apps and webpages. It shows my name, avatar, and contact details. 
It also shows my Placeholder images for my projects, that will eventually change to real screenshots of deployed applications.
